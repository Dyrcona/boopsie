  <!-- Configure sites below inside a site element with an id attribute. -->
  <!-- The code currently looks for the following child tags:
       Tag		Text Value
       ======		============
       host		ftp server's domain name
       user		ftp username
       passive		if present use PASV mode ftp
       password		ftp user's password
       cwd		ftp directory (if we need to cwd after login)
       emailTo		add 1 for each email recipient

       You can add an 'onError' attribute with value of 1 to the
       emailTo tag if you want that user to receive error emails as
       well as success emails.

       You may remove any tags that you don't need.

       You may configure as many sites as you need.
